# Gemini Notes

This file contains notes and context for the Gemini AI assistant to help with the development of the mediNote project.

## Project Overview

**mediNote** is a data engineering project that demonstrates a full-stack workflow for processing and analyzing unstructured healthcare data. The key objectives are to ingest simulated patient notes, enrich them with AI models (NER and summarization), store the data in appropriate databases (MongoDB for unstructured, ClickHouse for structured), and model the final data using dbt.

## Core Technologies

*   **Data Ingestion:** Airbyte (simulated)
*   **AI Integration:** Hugging Face
*   **Data Storage:** MongoDB, ClickHouse
*   **Data Transformation:** dbt, SQL
*   **Language:** Python

## Development Notes

*   The user is currently working on setting up the initial project structure.
*   The user has created a `dev` branch for development.
*   The user has expressed that this is a training project.
